#1 Python is open source language

#2 Python is called interpreter language
##2.1 Python is called interpreter language because it does not compile
##2.2 Does not compile means it does not create pre-memory
##2.3 Does not create pre-memory means memory will be create on run time
##2.4 Creating memory on run time is called as dynamic memory allocation
##2.5 Anything that is dynamic allotted is what we call as scripting language
##2.6 Scripting language can also be interpreter language

#3 Memory management in python is carried out by python virtual memory
##3.1 Python virtual memory is called as PRIVATE HEAP
##
##4 Python is called as unstructured programming language
##4.1 Unstructured programming language means writing the code without any templet to be followed
##
##5 Python is automated garbage collection
##5.1 Automated garbage collection means variable that is not in use will be removed from the memory
##
##6 Python is case sensitive
##
##7 Python is indent specific
##
##8 Python is sequential program execution
##8.1 Means it will read character or line by line
##8.2 This line by line execution is happening because of the concept of GIL
##8.3 GIL means Global Interpreter Lock
##8.4 Means when one line got executed next line will be locked
##8.5 Because of this mechanism python will be slowness comparing to other language
